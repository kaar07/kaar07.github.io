title: Thinking Out Loud
---

Why do I think out loud?
Because I think of expressing, not like "I think of expressing it" expressing; more like "I think of expressing just like I think of  thinking for the sake of thinking" expressing.  
Chaos everywhere!  
In the flow and in context repetition is a reiterable property. Makes things vulnerable.  
Flushing it out it here!
