    <title>An infatuation with titanium</title>

    <p>
      The first time I appreciated a metal was not about its ubiquity. Rather it was about thermal conductivity.<br />
      The average temperature of human body is more than that of the earth's surface,
      which facilitates many instances of heat transfer from epidermis to metallic surface. And because energy is transfered from our body
      to the metal, thermoreceptors allows passage of ions resulting in a cooling sensation.

      The fact that I live only 15<sup>o</sup>
      to the north of equator amplifies this cherishment. <br />
      Unfortunately, I have not yet experienced the same with Titanium.

    <h2>About Titanium</h2>
    She's 22, and about five times denser than human body. (By the way, did you know that sea water is denser than human body?)
