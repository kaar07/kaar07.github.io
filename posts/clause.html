      Plato suggests that the best way to govern society is by employing the concept of <em>'Philosopher kings'</em>.<br />
      Kings? So back to monarchy? Not exactly!<br />
      The philosopher ruler, according to plato, is in relentless pursuit of knowledge, wisdom and truth
      while having chosen to live a simple life.

      The pardox that fills TV commercials are more than often quite funny.<br />
      For instance consider beauty lotions:
      <i>The new xyz lotion repairs the dead skin and gives a natual glow to your face. xyz, every women's secret!</i><br />
      And baaam!... they are gonna show you a wave moving across a already good looking women, and as soon as the wave passes over her face
      the lighting onto her face is increased perhaps accompanied with extra makeup. So much for natural glow!

      One of the startling realizations I had was that commercials are not to taken word-per-say. They are intended to seed in the brand name
      and the product in the minds of consumers. Yeah, that made sense! However I have not yet stopped wondering how many people knew this?
      And that my dear friends, is the world we are living in!

      Nah! I am more interested in the deception in it.<br />
      The same deception that lies in morality, justice and almost all sorts of human inventions. On the contrast, nature is more honest
      and pragmatic. It is unfair in many aspects, and it doesn't hide it.

      Consider this: As a children we are taught that killing is wrong.
