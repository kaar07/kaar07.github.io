In absence of a common stand against killing, killing becomes a tolerable act.  

You can kill anyone.  
Anyone can kill you.  
You can choose not kill anyone.  
But you cannot choose not to get killed by anyone.  

Say things line up very well and you don't get killed. But you don't know that beforehand and therefore you have to live in a constant fear of being killed.
