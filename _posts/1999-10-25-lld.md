### No Gospel or Thaum

No one has a definite answer to anything. Even the most promising scientific theories are based on ground assumption.  
Collectively we pretend like we have fair amount of idea of what human race wants for itself. Individually we pretend like we know what we want. And yet more often people are inclined to think that *'may be someone has an answer'*. Someone, huh?  
Or maybe something, right?  


### The bubble

Sometimes I wonder why it is that art forms are often far from realism?  
May be it is the desirability factor that prompts us to connect our thoughts to fantasies.  
But are we not rational enough to evaluate our desires as to which can be made possible and which can be not?  
Oh wait.. are we?  

### Anti-optimism

We humans collectively sound very optimistic. (Or should I say *'we try to...'*)
What would happen if a fairly large asteroid deviates from its original path and hits our planet?  

Who cares right? Have you ever seen something like that happening?  
To be honest whether we care or not depends on probablity. Not of the event, but whether we are aware of such possibility and its consequences.
Optimism is great when we are dealing with the most probable outcome. But what if we are not sure of those probabilities.  

*Knock..Knock..!*  
*Who's that?*  
*I am AI*  

*Knock..Knock..!*  
*Who's that?*  
*Life*
