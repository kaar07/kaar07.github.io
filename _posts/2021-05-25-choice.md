We don't have the liberty not to make a choice. It is possible to stay deluded and believe that our choices are skewed among finite predicaments. But it is just not!
Choice is like Russel's paradox. No concrete isomorphism between them, but the similarity is compelling.

World isn't binary, just like numbers aren't just binary. Of course we could construct entire range of natural numbers using 0 and 1. Maybe with a couple of tweaks we can construct entire range of integers. With a couple more we can construct all rational numbers. But then things become complex. As a matter a fact, if we keep tweaking our rules and adding new ones we can finally make sense of everything. However, by then we would've established that world isn't binary.

Unlike priorities, choices are infinite and in a sense immortal. They can exist without us. The paradox of choice can be summarized completely with a single statement:

  > ### You cannot choose nothing.


Let that sink in.
