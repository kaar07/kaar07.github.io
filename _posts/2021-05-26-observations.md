# One.

Over time, I have recurringly arrived at realizations that something I was doing was so stupid. No, it's not like "it could've been better". It's more like "wtf was I doing".  

In a way it is relaxing, because I consciously aware that I am learning. But that isn't enough.  
This is probably common to everyone. Maybe it's how transition takes place. Can we avoid the shitty-part?  
Should we avoid? (*personally I believe we shoudld*)

# Two

Health. Physical and Mental health. Without'em we'll have to live a hard time.  
People overestimate being ripped or muscular, and underestimate being fit.  
We also underestimate sleep.  

The transition from 19th to 21st century has been a transistion to increased sedantary lifestyle. Given that we moved a lot for many millinuems a sudden settling down was quick, it's better we consciously take measures to stay fit. Also, unless regulated our food behaviour is quite pathetic. (mine was)  

Decent exercise/movement, sleep and nutrition. Healthy. Efficient.
