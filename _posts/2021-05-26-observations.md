## One.

Over time, I have recurrently arrived at realizations that something I was doing was so stupid. No, it's not like "it could've been better". It's more like "wtf was I doing".  

In a way it is relaxing, because now I am consciously aware that I am learning. But that isn't enough.  
This is probably common to everyone. Maybe it's how transition takes place. Can we avoid the shitty-part?  
Should we avoid? (*personally I believe we should*)

## Two

Health. Physical and Mental health. Without'em we'll have to live a hard time.  
People overestimate being ripped or muscular, and underestimate being fit.  
We also underestimate sleep.  

The transition from 19th to 21st century has been a transistion to increased sedantary lifestyle. Given that we moved a lot for many millinuems a sudden settling down was quick, it's better we consciously take measures to stay fit. Also, unless regulated our food behaviour is quite pathetic. (mine was)  

Decent exercise/movement, sleep and nutrition. Healthy. Efficient.  


## Three

Social interaction can be explained as one form of 'cue and reaction'. It is possible to get into a state where an individual doesn't find the need for social interaction or considerations. However, the pursuit to do so would be a really hard one.  

I can avoid people. I can disregard their existence. But not forever.

## Four

Uncertainty governs most of our actions. We are ignorant about life after death, so we avoid death. We are ignorant about anything that is novel. So, we avoid change. This is quite contradicting. Because, our entire lives we pursue making things more certain. And we evolve only when uncertainties are embraced.

## Five

It is optimistic to think that we can change people. But we just can't. Especially without hurting them or jeopardizing the relationship with them. Maybe we could change kids. But not adults. It has to happen by itself.  
If it is really important to change them, we could try to shed some light onto those specific aspects but nothing much can be done.  
But people should be able to change their perspective when needed. Attachment to a specific narration can grow to be harmful. One way to do this, is to impart rationality at young age.
