title: Why Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment is possibly a myth?

Leaning Tower of Pisa is about 57m high.  
Neglecting wind effects, an object thrown from a height of 57 meters would travel at speed more than 30 meters/second. And at that speed it would be impossible to distinguish the simultaneity of two objects if they nearly comparable.  

### How about different sized objects?
Different sized objects are a *'strict no'* for the Leaning-Tower-of-Pisa experiment as it conflicts . Sure you could just try to deduce something by using *Center of Mass* as a reference. But then there is the speed issue for naked eye observation as mentioned above.  

Besides, body with larger size would have larger area. Wind resistance, although tempting to be discarded in theory, is not negligible when throwing on object from a height of 57m. And differences in area would surely affect the speeds.  

### Hmm.. how about objects of same size but different mass?
In such a case, we don't have to bother about center of mass. We still have the speed problem. Naked eye is not so advanced. With advanced cameras available now, we could demonstrate a bit of the experiment on a nearly windless day. But sorry, even the first camera was invented as late as 19th century.  

### What if Leaning Tower of Pisa is not as high as 57m?
Actually it "is" about 57m high. We can't deny that. However, if the experiment was conducted from a shorter height it would've  been easier to establish simultaneity and insignificance of mass.

### Then what did Galileo actually do?
Galileo's significant contribution to the physics of motion is disproving Aristotle's notion of motion proportional to mass. But he probably did not climb Leaning Tower of Pisa to do so. The Leaning Tower experiment is said to have no mentions in Galileo's own works.

Instead he used Inclined planes. The following article provides a decent summary of the experiment:
