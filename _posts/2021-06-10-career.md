At a point when I almost gave interviews for developer jobs in some start-ups I got into a situation in which for the first time I asked myself *Is software development what I want to do for the rest of my life?*

Computers are interesting. In fact, I find it very similar to mathematics. Actually, it is mathematics.  
Wait what not is mathematics?
