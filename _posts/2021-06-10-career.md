At a point when I almost gave interviews for developer jobs in some start-ups I got into a situation in which for the first time I asked myself *Is software development what I want to do for the rest of my life?*  

The line of thought that followed was quite crazy.
Especially because the answer was "NO"!

Reading about Steve Jobs made me dream big.  
Learning about big companies, their inception and the growth that followed made me dream big.  
But neither got me interested in computers.

My first obsession with brains within semiconductors started out when I played the classic Brick Game on handheld gaming console. I didn't know about the semiconductor part. All I had was plastic device with some buttons. All I knew was it required a battery to run. And all I did was play on it. Sometimes hours long. As I grew up games became more complex and graphical.

The optimism that a cloud based todo-list system that has a cross device auto sync functionality would finally solve our productivity problem, is compelling.
