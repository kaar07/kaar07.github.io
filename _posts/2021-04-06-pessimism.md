# Poorly written poem.

  >Why? Why? Why?  
  >Is it because Oscar Wilde was true about tragedy?  
  >Or is it because we are just a bunch of hypocrites?  
  >For we speak ideals and morality but keep tweaking'em.  
  >We have ambitions and goals, but we do something else.  
  >And under those selfless masks are selfish people,  
  >ironically bothered by others' opinions.  
  >Or is it because we just lack the courage?  
  >To try things, to fail and to be proved wrong.  
  >To change ourselves or to move on.  
  >To take the road not taken.
  >To be alone.Or to die.
  >Or is it because we just don't see?  
  >The obsoletion of religion and absurdness in dogma.  
  >The propensity for bias,  
  >in every idealogy that ever came out.  
  >The insignificance of our own self,  
  >in the grander scheme of time and space.  
  >Or is it because we are not honest enough?  
  >For we admire not the virtue, but its possession.  
  >Or is it because we really think that darkness is an entity?  
  >That ignorance is inferior, not the choice that resists to change.  
  >That good and bad are two different things.  
  >And that there is right and wrong.
