      It is compelling: how we created amorphisms between knowledge and ignorance with light and darkness.
      After all we live in a universe encapsulated and filled with darkness where light is merely fragments of sources
      travelling here and there. Therefore such an association is tad ironical. <br />
      We also use light and darkness to explain human nature. Light with goodness and darkness with evil.

    <p>
      Do not curse or suspend your metaphorizabilities for suggesting that evil is much more than good.
       Scientific realism suggests that we make observations and create a comprehensive model
      about reality. Abstractions are our way of making an assurance.
