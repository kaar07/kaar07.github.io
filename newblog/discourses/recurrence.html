    <h1>Altruism</h1>
    <i>(The following is my opinion!)</i>

    <p>
      Can Altruism exist without the existence of humans? Can it exist without anyone perceiving it?<br />
      Well, that depends on our distinction between co-operation and Altruism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cells exist and work in co-ordination with other cells. Living body mechanisms except for single celled organisms involve
      a phenomenal range of co-operation between cells. However, none of them are said to be altruistic. <br />
      I think it is safe to say that the distinction between co-operation and altruism is intent. Co-operation comes naturally
      when being born in into a regulated system. It might or might not serve altruistic purposes. However, altruism is explicitly
      about serving an altrusitc purpose with the intent of serving that purpose.
