    <title>An infatuation with titanium</title>

    <p>
      Truth be told, it is actually the name: <i>Titanium</i>. There is some elegancy and style in it.<br />
      The first time I appreciated a metal was not because it is ubiquitously used or because of it's specific purpose.
      Rather it was about thermal conductivity. The average temperature of human body is more than that of the earth's surface,
      which facilitates many instances of heat transfer from epidermis to metallic surface. The fact that I live only 15<sup>o</sup>
      to the north of equator amplifies this cherishment. Unfortunately, I could never do the same with titanium.
