    <h2>Untie the knot</h2>
    <p>There is this famous passage about Abraham Lincoln which enlists all his failures.
    It is particularly used to inspire people. <br />
    Although the listing is mostly shown as one-sided by listing just failures
    (to compare check <a href="http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/education/failures.htm">here</a>),
    set-backs in his life were not easy to cope up, by normal standards.</p>

    <p>Now imagine if he never got elected as the president. Imagine he got defeated when running for president.
    We are tempted to think that he wouldn't have been the same person as he is now. At least to majority of us.<br />
    Moreover, he himself wouldn't have been the same person as he was when dying at the age of 56.</p>   








    <p>That makes me think, would people regard him the same way like they do now if he never got elected as president?<br />
    In the context of our perception it changes everything, right? Further, his personal image about himself would've been different.<br />
    But is it so obvious?
    That a person's 50 years of life is worthless if did not succeed at a large scale?</p>

    <p>There's a fundamental flaw in our extrapolation of happiness from survival instincts. Living long is nice and desirable.
      However, life span of an organism is not a choice at individual level while happiness is. People have realized that living
      longer may not be everything that they would want for themselves. Then why not tie success with accomplishment rather than
      winning? Why not use the phrase "succeed at doing" rather than "success"? Above all why not untie so called "success" and
      "happiness"?
    </p>

    <p>
      When survival is at stake you probably won't be happy, and that's survival instinct.
      Deal with it. Do something about it.<br />
      But when you don't "succeed at something", should you choose to be sad and gloomy?
