      Imagine a conversation between two wise individuals. One, a professor in philosophy
      at one of finest university in the world who talks philosophy in terms of utilitarian inputs and outputs. The other,
      a scientist interested in philosophy whose contradictory views often get rejected despite being sensible on multiple levels.
